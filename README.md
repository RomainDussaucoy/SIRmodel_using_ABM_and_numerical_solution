# SIRmodel_using_ABM_and_numerical_solution
Exploration of the difference of the SIR model between an agent based model (ABM) and the numerical solution.

Using 'mesa' package for create and compute the ABM model.
Using 'odeint' function from 'scipy.integrate' package for numerical solution.

The ABM model is calculate in a probabilist way.
All parameter are fixed randomly.
